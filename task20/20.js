//Q20:Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, 
//cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
//Making a cities names array
var cities = ["Karachi", "Lahore", "Islamabad", "Faisalabad", "Rawalpindi", "Multan", "Gujranwala", "Quetta", "Peshawar", "Hyderabad"];
// Printing the list of cities
console.log("List of cities:");
cities.forEach(function (city) { return console.log(city); });
